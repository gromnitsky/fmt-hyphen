My husband and I took a trip to the Southwest in 1978 in a 72 Chevy
Impala that had about 84,000 miles on it. Before the trip we had the
car serviced for the trip and bought four new tires for it.

All went well until we arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In pulling
into the motel, the muffler fell off. Next day it was replaced.

We arrived in Albuquerque ane the air conditioner had to be fixed. One
of the tires developed a bulge in Gallop, NM requiring a new tire. We
toured the canyons and had started to return to Pittsburgh via
Colorado. In Pueblo the engine quit due to a rocker arm failure. It
was replaced. In the middle of Iowa on a Saturday late afternoon two
more rocker arms blew. A great mechanic came in on Sunday and replaced
them just so we could continue our trip.


In Dayton, Ohio another tire blewâ€¦it seems that all the new tires were
defective. We were lucky in many ways because service places were all
around when the trouble happened and not in the desolate canyon
environs.
